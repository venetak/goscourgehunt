# Game Design

## Main Menu
You, Prince Arthas Menethil, arrive at the gates of Stratholme. But you are too late. The batch of infected grain was already delivered and distributed across the city. You must act now or soon the whole of Lordaeron will have mindless Scourge crawling around, killing innocent people.
### Select Game Mode
- [1] The Boy Who Killed Invincible
    - You'll be given a choice each time you encounter a Stratholme citizen. You'll have the option to purge or spare them.
    Your past recklessness proved costly, so now you resolve to act with care and choose the righteous path!
    “Invincible regarded him calmly, trustingly, as if he somehow understood what was about to happen, and the need for it.”  
- [2] Frostmourne Hungers
    - Kel'Thuzad's cunning manipulations have corrupted your soul, binding you as his pawn. Consumed by bloodlust, **Frostmourne hungers**. Sate its ravenous appetite with every living soul in Stratholme — humans, cats, dogs, rats in the cellars, and frogs in the ponds! "This kingdom shall fall, and from its ashes shall arise a new order that will shake the very foundations of the world."
- [3] Hunt Mal'Ganis to the Ends of the Earth!!!
    - AKA "I've heard this one before" - skip the purging of Stratholme and venture into Northrend to claim the Lich King's crown! Hint: You might encounter a certain pesky spider-like citizens of an ancient empire. "Oblivion awaits!" 
- [4] Your People are Already Doomed
    - Run to Silvermoon with Jaina and let Kael’thas marry you. "They stood side by side, watching the bonfires blaze and the revelers dance."

## Gameplay
 - [1]
    - You enter Stratholme wielding your paladin hammer. Each time you come across an NPC, the game is paused, and you are given a choice:
        - 1. Purge the encountered person
        - 2. Spare them
    If you choose 1 - your "scourged" (scourge purged) count will increase
    If you choose to spare them - you can either try to heal them with your paladin abilities
                                 OR they can mutate in front of your eyes and turn into an Abomination, and you'll have to fight it
